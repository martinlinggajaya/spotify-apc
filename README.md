# Spotify Automatic Playlist Continuation

Implementation of my undergraduate thesis entitled "Automatic Playlist Continuation Using Hybrid Recommender System".
This thesis is based on a paper by [Rubtsov et al. (2018)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3267471.3267488) enttitled "A Hybrid Two-stage Recommender System for Automatic Playlist Continuation".

This repo consists of the Jupyter notebooks used to train and test the algorithm used and a simple Flask demo app to showcase the algorithm at work.
